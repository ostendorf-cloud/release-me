# project, attaches them to the draft release release-me just created for
# each tag in TAGS, then publishes it.
#
# goreleaser never touches the GitHub release itself here (--skip=publish):
# its own lookup of an existing release by tag cannot see a draft one
# ("get a release by tag name" excludes drafts), confirmed live against
# this repository. Every change to the release instead goes through gh,
# confirmed live to work against a draft: "gh release upload" to attach
# assets, "gh release edit --draft=false" to publish. See
# docs/adr/0001-draft-releases-until-assets-attach.md.
#
# TAGS is release.yaml's own "tags" action output: one tag per line, empty
# when release-me released nothing this run.

# job's own checkout in place: the job's checkout may sit on the base
# branch or a push's own commit, not necessarily the merge commit release-me
# tagged, in particular on the pull_request labeled/unlabeled trigger, and a
# locked family can tag more than one component from more than one merge
# commit in the same run, so each tag needs its own exact build. Detaching
# HEAD in place would rewrite this very script and .goreleaser.yaml out from
# under the still-executing shell, since both live in the checkout a
# detaching "git checkout" would switch to a different commit of; a separate
# worktree leaves the running checkout, and this script, untouched.

# "exit 1" stops the script early, for a tag whose release view, build,
