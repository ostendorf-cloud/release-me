# validates flags the same way real git does: "worktree add" only accepts
# "--quiet" and "--detach", "worktree remove" only accepts "--force", and
# anything else fails loudly with a message naming the flag, the same
# shape as real git's own "error: unknown option" for a flag a subcommand
# does not support. That is what caught "--quiet" on "worktree remove"
# here, a flag real git worktree remove has never supported; "checkout"
# and "fetch" need no output at all.
